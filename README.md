# War Over Special Recipe: Sushi Bar

This is the first project for CS321, in which I uploaded a game project from CS262 (game design).

## Game story line

You are a sous chef of a famus chef, chef Haruto. Chef Haruto has recently announced his retirement. To keep his sushi bar running, he left a special recipe to only one of his two most promising sous chefs. Chef Haruto has hidden the different ingredients around the restaurant.  You must navigate yourself through the restaurant and collect more ingredients than your rival does, but both you and your counterpart are armed, BE CAREFUL!

## Game Control And game rule

### Control: 
WASD to move around and space to fire for player 1. <br>
Arrow keys to move around and return to fire for player 2

### Rules:
Every player starts with 40 bullets at the beginning of each level. There are many blocks in the map, some are empty and some are hidden with power-ups and ingredients of the recipe and you need to walk there to claim the rewards. Shooting the other player wins you one piece of ingredient, the level ends when one of the player run out of lives. The one with more pieces of ingredient wins the game.
